# NetSoft 2020 - Tutorial 4
#  A Softwarized Perspective of 5G Networks

The main goal of this tutorial is to explore the softwarization in the 5G system composed of the radio access network (RAN) and the core components, following the standards defined by 3GPP, particularly the Release 15. The tutorial provides a brief overview of wireless mobile cellular networks, including basic concepts and the evolution through the called ‘generations’ of mobile networks. From a software perspective, the RAN is presented in the context of 4G and 5G networks, which includes the virtualized and disaggregated RAN. A significant part of the tutorial is dedicated to the 5G core, i.e., considering the Service-Based Architecture (SBA), due to its relevance and fully softwarized approach. The tutorial is motivated by a set of experiments. For each experiment, we make available a detailed manual and all the necessary software to replicate it. Some experiments can be reproduced using only a regular computer, e.g., a notebook, but some of them demand specific hardware, e.g., a software-defined radio (SDR).
